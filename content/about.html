                    <span>Hi there!</span>
                </p>
                <p>
                    I am a Senior Front-end Architect at a global financial company and an adjunct professor in Computer Science at the University of North Carolina. Web Development is my life long passion, but my professional career started in the late 1990's. Read more about it on <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/fabionolasco/" target="_blank">LinkedIn</a>.

                <p>
                    During day I spend my time coordinating front-end Projects, conducting researches and POCs on the latest technologies, defining standards for our Front-end Shop, providing technical solutions and recommendations, giving training and workshops, and assisting individual front-end developers in various challenges. At night, I have the opportunity to teach "Software Architecture and Design" to the undergrads and "System Integration"
                    to the graduate students.

                    The combination of my involvement with real world challenges, practical hands-on coding, and a strong theoretical foundation, has brought me valueable insights on how to increase the quality of front-end products and the efficiency of their development... in a way that is meaningful to organizations and to final users. Now it excites me to use some of my free time to share these constant insights help the front-end community through books, workshops, lectures, video courses, and blog posts.
