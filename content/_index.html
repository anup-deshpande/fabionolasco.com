            <a href="https://frontend-architecture.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/PFEA-Edition1-look-inside.pdf#page=11&zoom=150" target="_blank">Front-end Architecture</a> is a specialization of Software Architecture. It goes beyond low-level coding concerns and takes into consideration multiple criteria, such as internal and external forces, technologies' past and forecast, alignment with intenal and vendor systems, and more, in order to provide educated and adapted recommendations to front-end development.

            Aside from the conventional work of choosing a tech-stack, defining a data-flow, and elaborating the system design,
            Front-end Architecture is concerned with many other activities that are necessary to achieve the success of
            front-end products and their development, including, but not limited to:
            <ul>
                <li>Converting Non-functional Requirements into comprehensive techincal directives that are relevant to
                    front-end development;</li>
                <li>Team composition and management;</li>
                <li>Strategic representation/communication of architectural decisions to the various stakeholders;</li>
                <li>Documentation of architectural decisions (and its maintenance) in order to minimize unnecessary meetings
                    about topics alread discussed;</li>
                <li>Organization of Front-end Shops and definition of technical standards;</li>
                <li>Creation and optimization of dev-environments;</li>
                <li>Identification of reusability opportunities across multiple departments;</li>
                <li>Benchmark and R&amp;D to favor continued innovation and increase competitive advantage;</li>
                <li>Quality assurance to maximize maintainability and the longevity of front-end projects.</li>
            </ul>
