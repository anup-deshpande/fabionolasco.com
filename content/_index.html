                    target="_blank">Front-end Architecture</a> is a specialization of Software Architecture. It goes beyond low-level coding concerns and takes into consideration multiple criteria, such as internal and external forces, the past &amp; forecasting of related tecnologies, inferences regarding the growth direction for the applications, their alignment with internal and vendors' systems, and more, in order to provide educated and adapted recommendations to front-end development.
            </p>

                An opposing understanding comes from the popular use of the word "architecture", referring to the structure and interconnections of the internal pieces of a given application, including the organization of its modules, the tech-stack used, the data-flow, and so forth. However, those lower-level concerns are actually part of another area called "System Design". By using its proper name (System Design) we are free to reserve the word “architecture” for higher-level concerns which are also essential for the success of front-end development and front-end products, especially in the long run. Some of those high-level concerns are:
                <ul>
                    <li>Converting Non-functional Requirements into comprehensive technical directives relevant to front-end development;</li>
                    <li>Team composition and management;</li>
                    <li>Strategic representation/communication of architectural decisions to the various stakeholders;</li>
                    <li>Documentation of architectural decisions (and its maintenance) in order to minimize unnecessary meetings
                        about topics already discussed;</li>
                    <li>Organization of Front-end Shops and definition of technical standards;</li>
                    <li>Creation and optimization of dev-environments;</li>
                    <li>Identification of reusability opportunities across multiple departments;</li>
                    <li>Benchmark and R&amp;D to favor continued innovation and increase of competitive advantage;</li>
                    <li>Quality assurance to maximize maintainability and longevity of front-end projects.</li>
                </ul>
            </p>
            <p>
                These concerns were previously covered by Software Architects. However, the immense range of knowledge on IT nowadays (Cloud, AI, Frontend, Backend, Security, DevOps, and so on) have made their contributions less relevant. Front-end development is a highly dynamic field and even its specialists have difficulty keeping up with it. So a specialization of Software Architecture is necessary - hence Front-end Architecture- in order to direct the work of front-end
                development in a meaningful way.
