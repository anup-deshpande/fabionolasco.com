        <h3>Book - Professional Front-end Architecture</h3>
        <p>
            To break free from the survival mode and move into “Continuous Innovation” we need to fundament our Front-end Architecture
            work over robust methodological principles. Choosing a tech stack and configuring a dev environment is simply
            not enough to guarantee a project's success. This book presents the concepts and the know-how (trade secrets)
            of an innovative approach to Front-end Architecture. Ready to bring your front-end projects to the next level?
